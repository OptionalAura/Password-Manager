# Password-Manager
A simple, open-source password manager written in C++. Uses Qt 5.15.2 for GUI and libsodium for encryption.
*If you require a secure password manager, do not use this. This is a personal project for fun and I am not educated in encryption. Use a professional password manager instead such as LastPass, or a community-driven one such as KeyPassXC.
