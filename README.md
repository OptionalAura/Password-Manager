# Password-Manager
A simple, open-source password manager written in C++. Uses <a href="https://www.qt.io/">Qt 5.15.2</a> for GUI and <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/">libsodium</a> for encryption.
<br>
<b>If you require a secure password manager, do not use this.</b> Use a professional password manager instead such as <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">LastPass</a>, or a community-driven one such as <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>.

This is a personal project for fun and I am not educated in encryption. I am not liable for any issues that may arise out of use of this program, including misuse or proper use.
